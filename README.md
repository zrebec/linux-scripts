# Linux Scripts Collection

A collection of useful scripts for customizing and improving your Linux experience, primarily focused on GNOME, KDE, and other popular desktop environments. These scripts will help you quickly configure your system according to your preferences without spending hours searching for solutions.

## Current Content

### GNOME Scripts
- **keyboard-switch.sh** - Configure keyboard layout switching with Alt+Shift (like in Windows), instead of the new default Super+Space in GNOME 47/48
- **gnome-gsettings-tips.sh** - Collection of useful settings for the GNOME desktop environment using gsettings

### Utility Scripts
- **symlink-finder.sh** - Find symbolic links in a specified directory and display their targets (can be filtered to show only directory symlinks)

## Planned Content

- KDE scripts for desktop environment customization
- Scripts for quick setup and cloning of AI repositories (Fooocus, ComfyUI, Forge UI)
- Additional utilities for easier Linux management

## Usage

Most scripts are standalone and can be executed directly. To run a script:

1. First, set execution permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script_name.sh
   ```

2. Then execute the script:
   ```bash
   ./script_name.sh
   ```

## Contributions

Contributions and suggestions for improvements are welcome! If you have an idea for a useful script that could be part of this collection, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
